# Shared SOS Node SDK agent contract
## Blocking local-first SDK release

Accumulate all grouped functional branches and changelogs without changing the
package version. Merge them to `main`, validate that cumulative state, and only
then create one version-only release branch. Preserve the exact published SHA
as immutable `stable/v<version>`; never increment once per feature branch.

The canonical contract is [`SDK_LAYERING.md`](https://github.com/Fundacion-UNID/sos-data-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/SDK_LAYERING.md). Its
indivisible order is **local packages -> full local test matrix -> merge every
validated branch to `main` -> publish bottom-up -> install exact registry
versions and commit lockfiles on `main` -> staging**. Never publish to discover
deterministic failures and never commit a local package reference. Staging
begins only after exact registry packages are installed and verified.


## Mandatory TDD

Write the smallest failing test before every behavior change. Begin every test
file with a `Flow contract:` comment and prove positive, negative and retained
compatibility behavior.

## Package boundary

- Consume runtime-neutral authorization and orchestration from
  `sos-sdk-core-ts`.
- Keep product-neutral Node transport, credentials, persistence and jobs here
  so SOSChain, Vet and UHC do not duplicate them.
- Do not duplicate types or deterministic builders from `sos-data-utils-ts`.
- Do not put Vet or UHC product policy here; use their public SDK contracts at
  an explicit SOSChain integration boundary when required.
- Keep new functionality out of frozen GW CORE v1 and `gdc-*`.
- Never commit Git, workspace, vendored or `file:` dependencies.
- For prompt audio, consume the canonical descriptor produced by
  `sos-data-utils-ts/prompt-audio`; never reproduce its fields or cache a live
  OTP as one object. Prewarm paid synthesis sequentially and bound every test
  run to one worker/process unless an isolated matrix explicitly requires more.
