# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.15 - 2026-10-22

- Add product-neutral verification and resolution for an existing professional
  DID, employee-authorization URN or signed professional SHC. Invitation and
  device registration remain separate host-managed operations.

## 0.1.14 - 2026-10-21

- Add a product-neutral server-profile owner assertion for personal passkey
  registration. It binds the selected profile to the authenticated Firebase
  principal without misinterpreting an individual-member actor DID as a
  professional employee identifier; mandatory passkey enrollment after PIN
  verification remains unchanged.
- Accept the browser WebAuthn secure-context exception for local loopback
  origins while continuing to reject plain HTTP origins on remote hosts.

- Adopt the product-neutral secure organization registration runtime previously
  specialized in the clinical Node SDK: reviewed controller bootstrap-wallet
  reconstruction, encrypted verification/reissuance transport, Offer-to-Order
  confirmation and terminal OperationOutcome rejection. Portal forms, sector
  admission policy, profile persistence and deployment values remain outside
  this package.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-10-21

- Add the trusted-BFF host organization directory client. It submits and polls
  the canonical host `org.schema/Organization/_search` route, reads a
  DIDComm-wrapped paginated Bundle, preserves opaque cursors and surfaces
  Bundle `OperationOutcome` failures without accepting browser-selected host
  authority. The same client performs status, suspend, reactivate and purge
  operations and reads their authoritative Bundle results.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-10-21

- Add the product-neutral server passkey state machine used by SOSChain, UHC
  and Vet BFFs. It requires platform user verification, binds credentials to
  one verified login and profile, and releases a sealed profile-unlock secret
  only through a short-lived, one-time server grant.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-10-20

- Keep valid owned human cards discoverable when the same verified identity
  also has active profile or controller licenses whose authorized subject is
  not a card DID; malformed card-shaped DIDs still fail closed.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-10-20

- Discover canonical animal cards through any governed `animal-*` sector,
  including `animal-research`, instead of treating `animal-care` as the only
  animal subject directory.

- Send authorized-subject directory submit and poll envelopes with the
  canonical `application/didcomm-plain+json` media type so compat-mode SOS
  gateways do not reject card discovery as legacy JSON.
- Add the shared trusted-BFF authorized-subject directory client with canonical
  SOS GW Organization/License routes, real submit/poll HTTP coverage,
  independent `sameAs` alias matching and fail-closed animal-card DID
  validation.
- Document multiple-controller ownership and future explicit principal
  controller promotion without changing the child or animal subject identity.
- Add the 2026 development-owner notice and re-establish the public repository
  from a clean source snapshot while
  retaining this changelog as the package release record.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-10-05

- Add a short-lived HMAC-protected email assertion for exact BFF-to-BFF
  audiences and purposes. It normalizes the authenticated email and fails
  closed for weak secrets, altered payloads, expiry and cross-audience reuse;
  it is not a browser-selected mode or an authorization capability.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-10-04

- Add one atomic accepted-handover persistence boundary for the
  Encounter/EncounterHistory projection, future professional Group audience
  revision and family-safe journey event.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-10-04

- Add the product-neutral confidential channel cache shared by SOSChain,
  VetChain and UHC Next.js BFFs. One profile-and-channel document stores
  materialized FHIR Communication messages behind the unlocked profile's
  confidential-storage adapter, skips already opened source JWEs and keeps
  subject, channel, recipients and payload out of cleartext persistence.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-10-04

- Add the injectable protected Bundle-sync service used by trusted runtimes for
  clinical documents, Consent, emergency contacts and Encounter transfers.
  It persists the exact retryable draft, enforces idempotency and confirms a
  mutation only after authoritative provider readback.
- Pin `sos-sdk-core-ts@0.5.1`, which owns the portable synchronization state
  and response reconciliation contract.

- Link the coordinated clinical accessor adoption boundary and keep optional
  portal/assistant editor work out of the Node adapter until runtime behavior
  is actually required.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-09-27

- Serialize Node test files so package and publication gates cannot exhaust a
  shared developer workstation with parallel workers.
- Require one version change only after grouped changes are merged and tested,
  and preserve every exact published version on an immutable stable branch.

- Add the product-neutral immutable prompt-audio Node runtime with stable
  SHA-256 object keys, durable filesystem storage, concurrent-miss coalescing,
  sequential prewarming and an ElevenLabs multilingual-v2 adapter.
- Correct the package boundary: SOSChain, Vet and UHC may reuse this Node
  runtime while keeping their sector policy in their own SDKs.
- Add a product-neutral, create-only GCS prompt store so identical reviewed
  assets can be reused across Vet, UHC and Connect ICA without sharing live
  OTPs, personalized speech or clinical data.

## 0.1.2

- Add the Node CSPRNG adapter and factory for the shared multi-recipient ML-KEM
  secure-message core used by written and binary-audio payloads.
- Keep Node limited to validated `node:crypto.randomBytes` output; ML-KEM, KDF,
  CEK wrapping and AES content protection remain in runtime-neutral core.

## 0.1.1

- Apply the blocking main-before-publish release contract to the SOSChain Node SDK documentation and repository skills.

## 0.1.0

- Initialize the SOSChain-specific Node SDK above `sos-sdk-core-ts@0.2.0`.
- Add fail-closed authenticated emergency dispatch with HTTPS enforcement,
  idempotency and acknowledgement validation.
